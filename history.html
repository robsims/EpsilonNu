in 1969,
the complete history of Epsilon Nu can never be fully compiled. Each
Brother who passes through the UMass campus holds his or her own story
of how things happened. It has been said that one can learn from the
past; here at UMass, that saying holds very true, as each Brother of
Epsilon Nu has consistently regarded chapter history as a valued
treasure. Epsilon Nu keeps in touch with its roots by carrying on
traditions which have endured over decades, in hopes that future
Brothers will do the same.</p>

<h3>Our Chapter </h3>

<p>The Epsilon Nu Chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi was founded at the
University of Massachusetts, Amherst on May 16, 1969 by eleven
students, also known as our founding brothers.</p>

<p>Throughout our
<script>d = new Date(); document.write(d.getFullYear()-1969);</script>years
of serving bands, over 300 Brothers have been initiated into our
organization. Epsilon Nu has many honorary members:</p>

<h3>Creed</h3>

<p>We, the brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi, believe that service to
the
college or university band program fosters responsibility, loyalty, and
leadership; that a spirit of brotherhood is enhanced by the
participation in a band program; that music is a universal language and
truly the greatest of the arts; and that through fraternal
participation, each member will strive for the highest.</p>

<h3>Hymn</h3>

<p><em>Submitted by the Eta Gamma (Morgan State) Chapter.
Adopted by
National Chapter 1995. Arrangement and Words by Scott Jeffrey
Heckstall, Jr. (Eta Gamma 1977). </em></p>

<p>K K Psi, as we go<br>

Through this wilderness, here below.<br>

Guide my feet, through peaceful eyes.<br>

I am a Brother of K K Psi. </p>

<p>I do not know, how long 'twill be.<br>

Or what the future, holds for me.<br>

But this I know, if I must die.<br>

I am a Brother of K K Psi.</p>

<p>I do not know, how long 'twill be.<br>

Or what the future, holds for me.<br>

But this I know, if I must die.<br>

I am a Brother of K K Psi.</p>

<h3>Song</h3>

<p><span class="td_first">For college bands we
strive to do our utmost,<br>

Pledged are we to the Kappa Kappa Psi.<br>

Fraternal Spirit, brotherhood, and loyalty,<br>

Gather 'round ye Kappa Kappa Psi.<br>

This Brotherhood that binds us all together,<br>

It will be strong and never will die.<br>

It's built on love we have for our fraternity.<br>

Here's a toast to Kappa Kappa Psi.</span></p>
